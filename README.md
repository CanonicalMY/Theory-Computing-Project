Welcome to the personal repository for the UoM 2nd Year Physics with Theo. Phys. Theory Computing Project on the Monte Carlo Simulation of Phase Transitions. This repository serves as our collaborative workspace, where Wenyi and I explore the use of Monte Carlo methods to simulate phase transitions in magnetic systems, with a particular focus on the Ising model.

Here you'll find our project code, documentation, and regular updates on our progress. I will be detailing our methodologies, challenges, and findings as the project evolves.
